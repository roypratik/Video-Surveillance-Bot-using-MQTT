# Video-Surveillance-Bot-using-MQTT
A video surveillance bot with rotatable camera using MQTT. A bot on four wheels equipped with 2 motor drivers along with a raspberry pi interfaced with the GPIO pins. The camera of rpi is mounted on a servo motor so as to rotate the camera to 270 degrees.
The video surveillance feed is given directly to a web page with the miniumum lag possible and high frame rates depending on the connectivity.
A seperate node mcu connected to a 10k Ohms potentiometer which acts as physical real-time rotation of the servo motor on which the camera is mounted.
